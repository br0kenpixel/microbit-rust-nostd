# Micro:Bit - Embedded Rust template

This is a project template intended to be used with [`cargo-generate`](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate).

❌ This template does not use the standard library. I also have a [template for std projects](https://github.com/br0kenpixel/microbit-rust-std).

## Create project
```sh
cargo generate --git https://github.com/br0kenpixel/microbit-rust-nostd
```

### ⚠️ Notes
1. This template is designed for projects using Micro:Bit __v2__ boards.
